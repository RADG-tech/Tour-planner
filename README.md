# Tour-planner
This is the implementation of a simple Tour Planner made using the Graph Theory in Advanced Data Structures. The most common algorithm used for these projects is Dijkstra’s Algorithm. This project is implemented using the C programming language. With this we were able to develop a system which will plan a tour with shortest distance to the destination. Specifically, users can load a travel graph, then request routes according to one of three priorities – Price (the route that costs the lowest amount of money), Time (the route with the lowest total time travel time), Directness (the route with the fewest number of connections). Since we have used graphs for our Tour Planner project, we have used the Dijkstra’s Algorithm to find the shortest path to the destination selected by the user.
